I'll help you create this Animal Classification Project step-by-step using Google Colab and a Decision Tree Classifier. Let me search for a suitable Kaggle dataset first.Perfect! I found an excellent dataset for this project. The Zoo Animal Classification dataset on Kaggle is ideal for this assignment. It contains animal features like whether they have hair, feathers, lay eggs, etc., and classifies them into different types.

Let me create a complete step-by-step guide for you:Now let me create a working Colab notebook with actual executable code:Perfect! Now let me create a detailed step-by-step instruction document for you:## 📚 Summary

I've created a complete guide for your Animal Classification project! Here's what I provided:

### 1️⃣ **Dataset Found:**
I found the perfect dataset - the Zoo Animal Classification dataset from Kaggle, which contains 101 animals with 16 features like hair, feathers, eggs, milk, etc., classified into 7 animal types (mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, amphibians, insects, and invertebrates).

### 2️⃣ **Three Artifacts Created:**

**Artifact 1: Complete Code Guide** - Commented Python code with all 11 steps explained

**Artifact 2: Executable Code** - Ready-to-run code that you can copy directly into Google Colab. This includes:
- Automatic dataset loading from UCI repository
- Data exploration with visualizations
- Decision Tree training and visualization
- Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance
- Custom animal prediction example

**Artifact 3: Step-by-Step Instructions** - Detailed tutorial explaining:
- How to set up Google Colab
- What each feature means
- What each step does and why
- How to interpret results
- Submission instructions
- Troubleshooting tips

### 🎯 To Complete Your Project:

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Create a new notebook
3. Copy the **executable code** (Artifact 2) into your notebook
4. Run all cells from top to bottom
5. Review the outputs and visualizations
6. Save to Drive and share with "Anyone with the link"
7. Submit the link in your Word document

The code will automatically download the dataset and complete all requirements. You should get around 85-95% accuracy! Let me know if you need any clarification on any step! 🚀
